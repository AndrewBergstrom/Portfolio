I have years of experience demonstrating excellent communication and teamwork skills while being highly collaborative and eager to contribute, grow and lead. Having graduated from University of Washingtonâ€™s full stack web development bootcamp, I have experience and understanding of multiple front-end languages and libraries such as HTML/CSS/JavaScript, JQuery, React.JS. I also have a special interest in back-end development using MySQL, API Interaction, MongoDB, and Mongoose.

I'm very passionate about the natural world and technology, currently looking for a way to merge my unique skillsets together.

Co-workers of mine have always complimented me on my desire to learn, and my ability to be comfortable in a fast paced, ever-changing environment.
